ðŸ’° EASY-TRACK: Financial Tracker App Design (UI/UX Case Study)

ðŸš€ Project Overview

EASY-TRACK is a mobile application design (UI/UX) aimed at simplifying personal finance management for the modern user. The primary goal was to solve common pain points in budgeting and expense tracking by focusing on minimal input effort, clear visual feedback, and strong budget control.

This project was prototyped using Figma.

âœ¨ Key Features & Solutions

The design directly addresses user pain points by focusing on three core solutions:

Minimal Effort Logging: The Add Transaction screen is optimized with a prominent Expense/Income toggle and quick-select category buttons, allowing users to log transactions in seconds.

Clear Visual Overview: The Home Dashboard provides a real-time balance and a simple budget progress bar. The Spending Analysis screen delivers actionable insights via a clear, modern bar chart and a category breakdown.

Real-Time Budget Control: The budget widget is designed to give instant feedback on spending limits (e.g., 70% used), helping users avoid overspending.
